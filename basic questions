What is intune?
Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that helps organizations manage and secure their devices, apps, and data. It’s part of the Microsoft 365 suite and allows IT admins to configure 
and control mobile devices (like smartphones and tablets) as well as PCs. Intune is especially useful for managing BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments and ensuring that corporate data is protected on personal devices.
Some of the key features include:------
Mobile Device Management (MDM)          : Helps organizations enforce security policies, such as requiring PINs or passwords, remotely wiping data from lost or stolen devices, and controlling access to company data.
Mobile Application Management (MAM)     : Allows businesses to manage apps on personal devices, ensuring that sensitive company data within those apps is secured.
Conditional Access                      : Grants or blocks access to corporate resources based on certain conditions, such as device compliance, location, or user identity.
Integration with Azure Active Directory : Ensures that access is tightly controlled based on the user’s role and device security status.
It's commonly used by businesses to protect corporate data while providing employees the flexibility to work on their devices.
